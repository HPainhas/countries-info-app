## Countries Info App

Android app that uses the _free_ REST Countries API to display every country's flag, capital, population, currency, language(s), continent(s), and coordinates.
The app also has a _**Locate Capital**_ button which uses the Google Maps API to allow users to locate the country's capital in real time on the embedded Google Maps fragment.
